# StrideApi

Stride API is a lightweight, annotation-based API documentation and testing framework for Java Servlets. It provides an automated way to generate structured API documentation, enabling developers to efficiently understand and test their API endpoints. The framework scans servlets, extracts metadata, and generates documentation with support for request parameters, headers, request bodies, and responses.
